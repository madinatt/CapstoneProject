E-commerce Customer Insights and Shipment Tracking


Introduction
An international e-commerce company specializing in electronic products aims to gain valuable insights from their customer database. This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to study customer behavior and shipment tracking data. The dataset consists of 10,999 observations across 12 variables, providing information on customers, product shipments, and related factors.


Dataset Overview
The dataset includes the following information:

ID: Customer identification number.
Warehouse Block: The company's large warehouse divided into blocks (A, B, C, D, E).
Mode of Shipment: Various shipping methods, such as Ship, Flight, and Road.
Customer Care Calls: The number of customer calls regarding shipment inquiries.
Customer Rating: Customer ratings on a scale from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).
Cost of the Product: Product cost in US Dollars.
Prior Purchases: The number of prior customer purchases.
Product Importance: Categorization of product importance into parameters like low, medium, and high.
Gender: Male or Female.
Discount Offered: Discount offered on specific products.
Weight in Grams: Product weight in grams.
Reached on Time: Target variable, where 1 indicates the product did not reach on time, and 0 indicates it reached on time.


Project Objectives
Customer Behavior Analysis: Investigate customer ratings and determine if products were delivered on time.

Customer Query Handling: Analyze whether customer queries are effectively addressed, considering factors like product importance, customer ratings, and on-time delivery.

Machine Learning Models: Develop and compare various machine learning models to predict shipment delays. Choose models based on dataset characteristics.

Comments and Inferences: Provide meaningful comments and inferences throughout the project, interpreting findings and model performance.


Machine Learning Models
The selection of machine learning models for this dataset will be based on data exploration and characteristics. Potential models include, but are not limited to, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting. Model evaluation will consider metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


Conclusion
This project aims to extract valuable insights from e-commerce customer data, with a focus on understanding customer behavior, query handling, and predicting shipment delays. The application of various machine learning models will help uncover patterns and improve decision-making in the e-commerce company's operations.
